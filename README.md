# Beginner-Friendly Python Projects
Python Projects for Beginners
The objective of this repository is to build fun projects using Python. We will create 10 different projects:

- Turtle Race
- Quiz Game
- Coffee Machine
- Password Generator
- Caesar Cipher
- Hangman
- Higher or Lower
- Pong
- Snake

### Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge but Turtle Race, Pong, Snake requires intermediate knowledge of Python.

**Please read the readme file in each project before you start**

These projects are taken from Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python Course on Udemy. While the solution for some projects was the same as Angela's, I applied my own solution ideas to some of them.
