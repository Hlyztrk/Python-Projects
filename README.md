# Beginner-Friendly Python Projects
Python Projects for Beginners
The objective of this repository is to build fun projects using Python. Each project has its own readme file and explains how to build the project. I have also added a gif which shows the final project. So it is highly recommended to read the readme files in each project before starting the build. We will create 9 different projects:

- Turtle Race
- Quiz Game
- Coffee Machine
- Password Generator
- Caesar Cipher
- Hangman
- Higher or Lower
- Pong
- Snake

### Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge but Turtle Race, Pong, Snake requires intermediate knowledge of Python.

**Please read the readme file in each project before you start**

These projects are taken from Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python Course on Udemy. While the solution for some projects was the same as Angela's, I applied my own solution ideas to some of them.
