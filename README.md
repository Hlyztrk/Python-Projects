# Beginner-Friendly Python Projects
The objective of this repository is to build fun projects using Python. Each project has its own readme file and explains how to build the project. I have also added a gif which shows the final result. So it is highly recommended to read the readme files in each project before starting the build. We will create 9 different projects:

- Turtle Race
- Quiz Game
- Coffee Machine
- Password Generator
- Caesar Cipher
- Hangman
- Higher or Lower
- Pong
- Snake

### Prerequisites
- While basic Python knowledge is enough to build most of them, Turtle Race, Pong, Snake requires intermediate level of Python.

**Please read the readme file in each project before you start**

These projects are taken from Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python Course on Udemy. While the solution for some projects is the same as Angela's, I applied my own solution ideas to some of them.
